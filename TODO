In descending order of importance:
* make all the options in the options dialog work
* patch functionality (to include blending)
* use version numbers when available
* session management
* implement ed and rcs format
* merge text view GUI
* the tree view should show directory structure
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* Add support for diff3 (that is comparing 3 files at once)
