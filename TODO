In descending order of importance:
* implement blending the original file in (this helps in implementing the rcs and ed)
* implement ed and rcs format
* patch functionality
* use version numbers when available
* session management
* merge text view GUI
* the tree view should show directory structure
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* Add support for diff3 (that is comparing 3 files at once)
