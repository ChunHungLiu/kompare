FIX IMMEDIATELY !!!

* key navigation -> problem is in komparemodellist/kompare_part

* fix view (diffs only partly shown and such), compare to pre n7y to see what happenend

* fix connect widget with a singleshot timer for compensating for the delayed drawing of the qlistview

* ingo cant find any other problems yet.

!!! Must do before a merge back into HEAD !!!
* Write a kconfupdate script to convert the kconfigfile
  * the diff options now have their own group
  * the view options now have their own group
  * the Recent Files group has been renamed to Recent Compare Files

Extremely important:
* Fix the state of the actions when there are multiple files in the modellist!

Very important:
* Make sure unified and context actually work again !
* Implement the rest of the interface (compare3 etc.)
* Make sure the rest works too ! Still some problems parsing some files
* Other various things that need to be fixed asap (before 3.2 is released)

In descending order of importance:
* fix some drawing bugs in the connect widget (still some left, damn it)
* in-line diffing
* add support for handediting conflicts
* session management (should almost work)
* implement normal, ed and rcs format (normal got busted)
* merge text view GUI
* clicking in the connect widget should select a difference (tricky!)
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* Add support for diff3 (that is comparing 3 files at once)
* Add a kompare manual/document

Special requests:
Puetzk:
* Editing the TO pane
Falk:
* Allow only part of a change to be applied to the other file
Harlekin:
* Add search functionality, either in source, dest or both at the same time
HarryF:
* emit clicked() signal when on a diff with line number
aseigo:
* merge from dest to source instead of only from source to dest
(Workaround: swap source with destination and then apply the differences)
