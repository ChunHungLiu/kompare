In descending order of importance:
* implement blending the original file in (this helps in implementing the rcs and ed)
* implement ed and rcs format
* add support to load a diff and apply it and save the modified file
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* network transparency (support comparison of non-local files)
* add icons for most menu options (almost done, using standard icons now for most)
* Add support for diff3 (that is comparing 3 files at once)
