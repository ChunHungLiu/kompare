In descending order of importance:
* fix some drawing bugs in the connection widget
* patch functionality (including blending)
* intra-line diffing
* add support for handediting conflicts or is this what you meant with blending?
* session management
* implement ed and rcs format
* merge text view GUI
* clicking in the connect widget should select a difference
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* Add support for diff3 (that is comparing 3 files at once)
* Add a kompare manual/document (partially done)
Special requests:
Puetzk:
* Allow a directory to be magically patched with a diff file and show the full differences
* Editing the TO pane
Falk:
* Allow only part of a change to be applied to the other file
