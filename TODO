In descending order of importance:
* add support to save a diff
* implement context, ed and rcs format
* add support to load a diff and apply it and save the modified file
* implement multiple file support
* add support for incremental patch saving (i'll explain if anyone wants to know)
* cvs support
* add icons for most menu options
* perhaps a wizard for newbie/non-coders
