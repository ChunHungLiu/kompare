	Fixed a stupid bug that caused the last line in the rightview not
	to be colored.
	Implemented slots for using the KHistoryCombo in the views to select
	files with.
	Still a nasty bug with regard to the initial directory in the
	KFileDialog, needs to be fixed asap but i dont know the cause.
	Still an error in the historylist and completionlist items. They are
	not shown correctly.
