	* Fixed two problems in komparenavtreepart that made it emit a signal twice

June   29, 2003 : Otto Bruggeman
	* Fixed remaining part of bug 57774 (the context format parsing one)
	* Fixed bug 58144 by adding a check for comparing dirs, in that case
	  destinationURL is a directory and not a file name so we need to 
	  recreate the filename. This involved changing some code to use a 
	  different enum value, so i hope i did it the right way, session 
	  management may be broken now when the session was stored with 3.1.2
	  and restarted with 3.1.3. But that is unfortunately unfixable with a
	  kconf_update script.

May     3, 2003 : Otto Bruggeman
	* Fixed accel conflict
	* Moved Open Diff to the top of the menu

Apr    20, 2003 : Otto Bruggeman

Jul    15, 2002 : Otto Bruggeman
	* Fixed normal diff a bit more, filenames dont work yet
	* Removed some code duplication
	* Fixed diff output parsing with Common subdirectories in it
	* Fixed Copyright years (thanks Carsten Niehaus)
	* Removed the KShellProcess and replaced it with a KProcess

Feb    18, 2002 : Otto Bruggeman
	* Fixed scrolling with a wheel mouse in the kompare(list)view and 
	  connectwidget and added a config option for the number of lines
	  that is scrolled per wheelscroll.
	* Fixed the history somehow in the compare dialog.
	* Implemented the separate directory/file widget.
	* Implemented reading from stdin by using - as file on the commandline.
	* Partly implemented a better way for ed and rcs parsing, i'll
	  improve this before KDE 3.0 is released

	Comparing directories works now :) You can select them from the begin
	dialog, and select a directory and then press ok. It will enter the
	directory but dont select a file so it keeps the directory.
	Known bug here is that directories need a trailing slash :(

Oct    07, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Fix crash when part is not found, basically dont use kapp->quit() 
	but use exit(int). Would be interested to know why it crashes though,
	the bt gave nothing meaningful here. I should have compiled kompare with
	debug code.

Sep    17/18, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Fixed some stuff dont know what anymore (writing this on oct 7)
	Probably some more fixes for the klibloader.

Sep    17, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Moved to kdesdk and renamed to kompare with preservation of history.
	Changed almost every occurence of kdiff to kompare (not in this file).

Sep    08, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Removed the qt3back dir, changed everything over to qt3,
	qlist->qptrlist, qlistconstiterator->qptrlistconstiterator

Jul    29, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Add some tests.
	Add the qregexp3 backport.
	Use qregexp3 for diff parsing -- soooo much cleaner.
	All the diff options work.

Jul    28, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Directories can be selected in the compare dialog
	New base clase KDiff, holds some common stuff
	Use an enum for format in preferences
	Implement a save options dialog, displayed at "Save .diff"
	The diff can be run in any directory, the paths to source
	and destination will be automatically determined from this.
	Save all.

Jul    25, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Promt to save changes on close
	Show [modified] caption
	Clean up internal save mechanism

Jul    14, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	New menu item "Swap source and destination".
	Make empty selection work.

Jul    13, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Text view now works in compare mode.
	Fix clicking difference to select it.
	Don't scroll to difference when clicking to select it.
	Give the diff view a nice frame.

Jul    12, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Stats work now, maybe they need more info but i dont know what yet.
	Will think some more about it.

Jul    12, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	When comparing files, you can apply or unapply changes and save
	the result.
	New menu item "Show Text View" (loads the diff in embedded text viewer).
	Better status notification.
	Set the window caption when comparing.

Jun    27, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Ported main view to QListView
	Remove obsolete files
	Clicking a difference in the main view selects it
	Better scrolling

Jun    24, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Coverted to dock window and added navigation tree in a dock.
	Multiple file diffs are now supported. Each file will show up
	as an item in the tree, with differences as children.

Jun    22, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Tried implementing rcs and ed but they dont work atm, same for show
	diffstats, will fix that asap.

May    22, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Reworking of most of the view code. Looks pretty.

May    18, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Context seems to work, implemented saving... might have some problems
	left (saving that is)

May    15, 2001 : John Firebaugh
	Make the settings work for all windows. Probably some more changes :)

May    14, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	context diff does not work atm, there is some problem with the separa-
	tion of old and new. Maybe the old and new needs to be reintegrated.
	I fixed some functions and now diffmodel does no longer need static
	functions. All loading is done from the kdiffpart and that is where
	save should go as well. Removed determineDiffFormat because it is not
	needed anymore.

May    13, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	contextdiff is better implemented it finds all stuff in the diff atm
	but it does not work.

May    04, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	cleaned up the code by moving the part to a subdir
	halfassed implementation of contextdiff, will update later today

	work in progress

	icons for it but that will be solved in the near future...

Mar    25, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Moved the application icons to the pics dir

Mar    20, 2001 : Otto Bruggeman
	Fixed a stupid bug that caused the last line in the rightview not
	to be colored.
	Implemented slots for using the KHistoryCombo in the views to select
	files with.
	Still a nasty bug with regard to the initial directory in the
	KFileDialog, needs to be fixed asap but i dont know the cause.

	not shown correctly.
